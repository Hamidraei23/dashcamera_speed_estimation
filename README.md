# dashcamera_speed_estimation
Required Dataset for this project is available in the link below:
https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge
In this section all the files are ipynb and after download start from converting the video into the frames and then perform preprocessing on them.
1) Video to frames
2) preprocessing
3) trainning

This project uses dash camera to predict  speed of the car.

I used opencv and tensorflow package in this project.


# The Algorithm I used in this Project is described as below
